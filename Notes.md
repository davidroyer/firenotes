# Notes

## For `Module did not self-register` error in electron

1. Need to install `electron-rebuild` as dev dependency
2. Run `./node_modules/.bin/electron-rebuild`

## Preventing the app to work after login

This is the console message:

```js
Not allowed to load local resource: file:///callback?code=0lBuXnKChPhOgeRM
```
